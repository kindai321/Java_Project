# Java_Project
Flipzon
This is a Java Project employing OOP principles, e.g., interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism.

The application serves the following flow:

1) The application will have a command line based user interface where you can opt to enter as the admin of the application or as a customer.
2) The customers have been divided into three categories: “ELITE”, “PRIME”, “NORMAL”.The difference between these 3 categories is on the basis of the discounts/perks they get.
3) You as the admin of the application will add some product categories under which you need to add some products that the company wants to sell.
4) We can enter as users of the application. When you enter the application, the user can see all the products and explore them but one cannot add it to the cart and buy it when the user has not registered.
5) Once the user has registered on the application portal, the user becomes a “NORMAL” customer for the user by default. A user by default has Rs 1000 in its account. You can maintain a wallet attribute for each user (or customer) which stores the balance.
6) The user can buy a membership and purchase monthly/yearly subscriptions to upgrade to a “ELITE” / ”PRIME” customer. An “ELITE” membership costs Rs 300 and a “PRIME” membership costs Rs 200. Both the costs are for one month membership.
7) To buy a membership you should redirect to payment and deduct that amount from the balance of the customer.
8) Customers also get one time use coupons which they can apply and get a discount on the total amount to be paid. The details of coupons will be explained further.
9) The Customer can go through the list of products and choose items to add in the cart. Once all items are added in the cart, the customer can choose to delete items from the cart or checkout from the cart to pay the total amount. Once paid, the total amount will be deducted from the account of the user.
10) Please note that if the customer has insufficient amount in the account, decline the payment saying that there is not sufficient balance in your account.
11) You need to return to the home page after payment.
12) Once you are done shopping, you can log out from the account and sign in as another user.
